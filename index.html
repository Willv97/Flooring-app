History
Established in 1964.

In 1964 Bob Olah Sr. went into business for himself, starting Fairfield Carpet Center in Fairfield, CT. Back then he worked mostly in carpet and vinyl. At first, he rented a one car garage to store carpet and vinyl rolls. In 1999, Olah father and son acquired a warehouse in Milford, CT. In 2014 when father and son merged with another flooring company. Fairfield County Floor Covering launched with a retail flooring store in Monroe, CT. As big box stores emerged, and the business changed, they closed the retail store in Monroe, moving their showroom to the Milford warehouse. Today, the warehouse houses showroom, samples, offices plus offers climate-controlled storage for the many kinds of flooring Olah father and son now carry. Also important is a large area where they "build" floors ahead of installation. Because they closed the retail Monroe store, some web searches list the business as "closed." Nothing is further from the truth. Call them today to learn more.
